            Amazon Internship: Migration to the Airflow Workflow Orchestrator <br> May 2022 - Aug 2022
        </h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            I worked for a team that develops a product called DownStream Impact: an ML and big data based product, which is used to forecast financial 
            investment and the "downstream impact" for any given program based on Amazon data. As part of the DSI architecture, we used a proprietary 
            Amazon workflow orchestrator to manage the DSI workflows and jobs. Due to poor support among other reasons, the goal of my project was to 
            migrate the old orchestrator code to <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a>, an open source alternative that is 
            widely used in industry. 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            In this role, as the first member of the team along with my mentor to use Airflow, I was responsible for:
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
                <li>Migrating our machine learning jobs from the old solution to Airflow, and to have at least the same functionality</li>
                <li>Designing the architecture and foundation of Airflow code for future DSI workflows, including style and structure</li>
                <li>Running full unit and integration tests of Airflow with the DSI pipeline.</li>
            </ul>  
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            In the end, I was able to fully migrate one of our workflows to Airflow, while at the same time establishing code and style 
            convention for DSI, exploring functionality and navigating issues around using Airflow as the first member of my team to use it, 
            and creating the foundation for future Airflow work in DSI. All while adding more functionality and flexibility to the workflow
            beyond just moving it to Airflow, by improving the code structure and design to be more maintainable and reusable down the 
            line compared to the old solution.
