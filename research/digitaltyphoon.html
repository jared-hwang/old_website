            Machine Learning for the Digital Typhoon Dataset <br> Prof. Asanobu Kitamoto, National Institute of Informatics, 2023
        </h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            The Digital Typhoon Project was started in 1997, and aims to collect, standardize, and make accessible satellite images 
            of typhoons over the Western North Pacific. It hopes to reduce the burden of researchers to start machine learning on tropical cyclones without solid
            domain knowledge of meteorology and satellite remote sensing.

           I developed Pyphoon2, a PyTorch based dataloader to easily access, filter, and transform dataset images for use in machine learning applications. You can read more and 
           find the code <a href="https://github.com/kitamoto-lab/pyphoon2">here.</a>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            I also led the benchmark experiments for the dataset, including classification and regression of typhoon intensity (wind and pressure), as well as forecasting 
            typhoon intensity and shape.
